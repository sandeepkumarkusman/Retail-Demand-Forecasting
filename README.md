# Retail Demand Forecasting

This project records and modularizes independently analyzed Kaggle approaches for the Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge. The goal is faithful, behavior-preserving reproduction of each notebook's methodology within the established project structure; it is not model redesign, optimization, or a hybrid solution.

## Current default pipeline

The default executable solution is `xyzt_awesome`, derived from `keeping-it-simple-by-xyzt.ipynb`. It is the only analyzed solution with a fully reconstructible end-to-end path from raw competition inputs through test prediction and submission generation.

This choice does **not** mean that `xyzt_awesome` was the overall competition-winning solution. The analyzed Top-1 description references a hardcoded-trend dumb model and an item-specific weekly-seasonality model, but its final executable training, prediction, combination, and submission code were not present in the available notebooks.

Other analyzed Kaggle solutions remain separate, notebook-specific implementations. They are not merged into the default pipeline.

## Data locations

Place the original Kaggle competition files in `data/raw/`:

- `train.csv`
- `test.csv`
- `sample_submission.csv`

Place external Kaggle artifacts that are required by specific notebook-only workflows in `data/external/`. Examples include precomputed cross-validation prediction files, candidate submission matrices for blending, and externally generated submission CSVs. These artifacts are not substituted or recreated by the default pipeline.

## Solution provenance

The analyzed notebooks include EDA/reference notebooks, several isolated factor-model submission pipelines, and two ensemble-only workflows that depend on unavailable external candidate predictions. The default pipeline is deliberately limited to the reconstructible XYZT implementation. See `reports/Final_Report.md` for the complete notebook inventory, implementation decision, and unreconstructible components.
